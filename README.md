# RPG-Helper
Hello World!
My name is Diogo, Im a noob programmer.
This project is my first program "complete", it isnt special, but it works , and Im used C to develop him.
Actualy he displays a table, with player's name, life, and sanity. 
The life and the sanity are simple to edit, its just use the third or fourth option.
I recently added a new function, where you can to roll how many and which dices do you want.
If have a orthographic error, Im sorry. Im a brazilian using your knowledge with subtitles series... and google translate.
